# 🛡️ StressPause Shield
### Proactive Loan Stress Detection & EMI Pause System (Fintech Backend Prototype)

> 🚀 A privacy-first backend system that predicts potential EMI stress before default and triggers proactive support workflows.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional lending systems detect loan default **after** a user misses an EMI.  
This reactive approach leads to:

- ❌ Aggressive recovery calls  
- ❌ Damaged customer trust  
- ❌ Increased operational cost  
- ❌ Higher default probability  

StressPause Shield introduces a **proactive early-warning backend system** that detects behavioral stress signals (user-consented, aggregated data) and temporarily pauses EMI collections to improve recovery success.

## 💡 Solution Overview

Instead of relying only on:

- Credit Score 📊  
- Bank Balance 💰  
- Transaction History 🧾  

This system uses:

- 📉 Change in outgoing call frequency  
- 📱 Increase in job-search app usage  
- 🌙 Late-night activity spikes  

These indicators are converted into a **Stress Score**.

If stress score > threshold →  
✅ EMI pause recommendation triggered  
✅ User notified  
✅ Loan officer dashboard updated

### Core Components

- REST APIs (Spring Boot)
- Rule-Based Stress Scoring Engine
- PostgreSQL Relational Database
- Scheduled Cron Job (Daily Risk Evaluation)
- Audit Logging for Compliance Simulation
- Loan Officer Monitoring Dashboard (API-ready)
